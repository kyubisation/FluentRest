FluentRestBuilder Documentation
===============================

FluentRestBuilder is a library to easily build RESTful APIs on top of `MVC Core <https://github.com/aspnet/Mvc>`_. 

It is based on the IObservable<T> and IObserver<T> interfaces and inspired by the Reactive Extensions (Rx.NET).
It is however not fully compatible with Rx.NET, as FluentRestBuilder extends the IObservable<T> interface.
